# Dominion & Control
A redefining of my Capture the Flag: Redux project with new insights into the Source engine and cleaner implementation methods. The primary aim of this project is to redesign core foundations at the implementation level, streamline gameplay, and promote a lightweight and robust code base free of excessive dependencies.

This project is built upon the popular sandbox game, Garry's Mod. See the store page on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/
