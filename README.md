# Dominion and Control

A redefining of my original capture the flag project with new insights into GLua and cleaner implementation methods. The primary aim of this project is to redesign core foundations of the gamemode at the implementation level, streamline gameplay, and promote a lightweight and robust code base free of excessive dependencies.
