-- This is commented out for now, but what the above function does is allow us to put in filters for ignoring entities when a map is cleaned up. This is especially
-- helpful for when we want to start new rounds and reset the map without removing critical entities like the team spawns and objectives established in the setup phase.
-- I added a wildcard example in the filter table that should encompass all entities we'll be making for the gamemode. This can and probably will change later.

function GM:InitPostEntity() -- This is called after the server has initialized the map and all entities within it
	CleanupMapEntities() -- Remove the entities we don't want in the map using the function defined in shared.lua
